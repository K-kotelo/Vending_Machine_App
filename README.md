# Vending_Machine_App

Problem

Design and develop a vending machine which vends products based upon four (4) denominations of coins and returns coins if there is no item.
We require you to develop a single page application that does the following:


• When the application loads, it loads data about all the instances from the products and Coins and visualizes this data in some way. (e.g. A table with all the data)
• The application must have some mechanism for refreshing all the data from the API without having to reload the entire application (e.g. A refresh data button)
• The application must have some mechanism for refreshing the data of only a section (products or coins)
• The application should show the user some indication that it is refreshing/loading new data
